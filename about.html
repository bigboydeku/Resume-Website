								<h1 class="text-grey centered">1997 – 2007 </h1>
								<p class="about-font mt-1 text-grey centered">
									I was born in the farm town of High River, Alberta.
									I grew up living around a mixture of different cultures.
								  I spent my days at school, gaming, and exploring the
									wilderness with friends. In 2007, my family decided to
									move to Windsor, Ontario. I attended Talbot Trail Public
									School for my elementary education..

								<p class="about-font mt-1 text-grey centered">
									My passion for Business and Computer Science began in
									freshmen year at Vincent Massey Secondary School.
									I developed a wide variety of skills while I attended
									the school and took enriched courses to further my
									knowledge in all the sciences and maths. I became
									familiar with Python as my first programming language.
									I even made a portion of the popular video game Pokemon.
									By the time senior year started, I have decided that
									I wanted to begin a Business-related path.

								<p class="about-font mt-1 text-grey centered">
									I started my university life at the University of
									Windsor as a Business Administration major and
									eventually switched into a combined major of Business
									Administration and Computer Science because I want to
									learn more. As I approach my final few semesters
									of this degree, I realized that I wanted to make
									Computer Science a bigger part of my life and have
									decided that I want to pursue a Masters degree in
									the future. With my knowledge of all the concentrations
									in Business and my passion to do something big with
									programming, I hope that I can make a organization
									proud of my efforts.

								<p class="about-font mt-1 text-grey centered">
									Growing up with Bosnian roots while going to school
									with Canadian and Chinese friends gave me a passion
									for diversity and ultimately resulted in my current
									love for languages. I’ve been studying Japanese for
									a few years and will be starting Korean.<br><br>
									Music has also been a big passion for mine. As mentioned
									before, I developed a wide range of skills and piano
									has been something that I’ve been working on for the
									past few years. Here are some of my covers. I consider
									 my biggest life goal to be a passion. My life goal is
									 to make a big impact in the world in some form.
